Go-Default
==========

This is simple random-infinite platformer and jump game in Unity,
uses default game objects. I will make gameplay and game balance better If I have time to.

##### Might be an example of couple of things listed below:

- How to build simple infinite platform randomly in game time.
- How to detect if a game objects touches another.
- How to perform simple actions, jump & move forward.
- How to detect if target on the screen view.

##### [Play here](http://harunurhan.github.io/go_default.html)

Although it doesn't have good gameplay and balance, it is playable.

It moves forward automatically, try not to fall and hit blocks. Collect as much as gold you can.
If you hit blocks five times, game over !

**A**: `jumps a little bit`, **S**: `jumps OK`, **D**:`jumps very long`
